# zladiscordbot
Bot for ZLA Discord

This Bot Includes Numerous APis that do have their limits, The only one with a limit has a 1,000 Requests per Day, so try not to request more than that LOL.

-----------------------------------------------

Bot Uses these node modules:
Axios (to get api)
discord.js (to connect to discord)
puppateer and cheerio (webscraping)
node.js (overall system)
Also uses Discord Embeds so the embed function is required


-------------------------------------------

Updates will need to happen as node packages update too.
Also discord.js uodates frequently so that would need to be updated also.
Should also be updated if and when Vatsim/ other aviation APIs update
----------------------------------------------------

Some commands use multiple APis so it could possible strain the server, so make sure to have one with a lot of ram/storage.
Webscarpe could be affected if LAARTCC website code is changed in a way that affects its ability to scrape informtion.

----------------------------------------------

Bot Token is needed, so DM Mr. Nasa Man#7426 for a bot token.
Bot tokens are custimized from teh discord developer portal so you will have to make sure it have the correct permissions.

For any question DM Mr. Nasa Man#7426

Thanks!
